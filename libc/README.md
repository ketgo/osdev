# Standard Lib

The folder contains the [Newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) source code which 
is used to port a standard C lib for building OS applications. Newlib is also used 
to generate nohost version of the lib which is used by the kernel for some standard 
string and memory manipulation functions.
